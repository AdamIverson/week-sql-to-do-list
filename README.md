# Weekend SQL To-Do List

## Description

***72-hour Sprint***

Sure, there are a lot of task apps and whatnot out there, but there aren't nearly enough chonky letters involved, so here we are. I don't like the term "Hero" either, but lots of people are saying it.

Enter tasks into input field and click Submit to add them to your list. There is one option to mark your task as completed via the COMPLETE IT button. There is a DELETE button that will delete the task with which it is associated.
